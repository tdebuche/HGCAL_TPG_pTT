This folder allows one to create a list with the z-coordinate of each layer and the bins (eta-phi bins = pTTs)/

Programs : 
  - import/compute the z-coordinates of layers
  - create a list with bin coordinates (for a single sector or for the whole endcap)
  - plot the layers with different items

Plots :

Plots of layers with different items (for different geometry versions) :
-
