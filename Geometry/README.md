This folder allows one to create a list with the z-coordinate of each layer and the bins (eta-phi bins = pTTs)

Programs : 
  - Z_coordinate : import/compute the z-coordinates of layers
  - ccreate_Bins : create a list with bin coordinates (for a single sector or for the whole endcap)
  - plot : plot the layers with different items
  - tools : some geometrical tools

Plots :

Plots of layers with different items (for different geometry versions) :
- Layers covered by the bins : Layers_with_Bins
- Layers with the u-v coordinates of each module : Layers_with_UV
- Layers with the rotation (the number of each module is the number of pi/3 rotations, the red point is the DCDC) of each module : Layers_with_irot
