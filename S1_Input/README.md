This folder allows one to create the module/STC numbering in each board used for the pTT mapping.

Programs : 
  - create_numbering : create the module/STC numbering
  - record_text : record the numbering (one file for the CE-E part of all S1 boards and the another file for the CE-H)

These programs are used in the 'pTTs' folder. 

In the Results floder, there are different geometry versions.
