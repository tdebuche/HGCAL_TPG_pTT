Programs :

  - Energy_sharing : python tools to create the energy sharing for one layer, for different scenarios (with/without edges, with/without STCs)

  - pTTs_to_file : programs to record 14*2 files for a given scenario. Files can be vh or readable (text) files. 

  - tools : some geometric tools used by the Energy_sharing program

Results :

In each version, you can create readable/ vh files, in different scenarios.
vh files are used to develop the firmware. Readable files are used for simulations (repository : S1-S2_interface_test)
