In each version, you can create readable/ vh files, in different scenarios.
vh files are used to develop the firmware. Readable files are used for simulations (repository S1-S2_interface_test)

v1 --> modmap v15.5 (CMSSW v16), STCs are arbitrarily defined. 

v2 --> modmap v15.5 (CMSSW v16), STCs are the good ones for the  entire modules but not good at all for the partial ones. Scintillator STCs need also some corrections
